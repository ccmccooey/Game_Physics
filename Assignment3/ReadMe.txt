Controls:
Arrow Keys: Move the camera
Page Down and Page Up: Move the camera up and down
Mouse: Holding the button down will rotate the camera on the y-axis depending on cursor position


Features: Boxes and Spheres can be created by using buttons on the screen. The set material and size determines the total mass of the object. Bigger objects will have more mass. Different materials have different masses. For example,
objects made of steel will have more mass than objects made of wood. The set material and set size can be changed by
using the buttons on the top of the screen.


Debugging: The button with the information icon will toggle debug information on and off. This bug information will
display the number of rigid bodies in the scene and the number of collision checks being used each frame.
The debug information will include information about the selected rigid body. There is an arrow that appears above
each rigid body that indicates the selected rigid body. There is a button that will change the selected rigid body.

Bugs: Right now there is a rotation bug where boxes continuosly spin on the ground.
